## Purpose

Every clan should adopt a few ground rules, as it creates a positive and supportive community for players to enjoy the game.
Rules may vary depending on the clan's goals and culture.
The purpose of this repository is to document our clan's rules.

## Rules

### Basic Rules

1. **All rules are subject to change at any time.**

   All rules are subject to change at any time.
   This is to ensure that the clan can always adapt to changing circumstances, such as new game updates or if a certain rule is not working well.
   The clan leaders will only change the rules when it is necessary for the good of the clan.

1. **The leader's decision is regarded as final in any case.**

   The leader's decision is regarded as final to ensure that the clan can operate efficiently and effectively.
   If the leader's decision could be challenged or overturned, it would lead to confusion and chaos.
   It would also make it difficult for the leader to make decisions in a timely manner.

   Of course, this does not mean that the leader is infallible.
   If the leader makes a decision that is harmful to the clan, the clan members should feel free to speak up and express their concerns.
   However, ultimately, the decision of the leader is final.

1. **The leader and the co-leader's may make exceptions to the rules on a case-by-case basis.**

   The leader and the co-leader's may make exceptions to the rules on a case-by-case basis to allow for flexibility and fairness.
   There will always be situations that are not covered by the rules, or situations where the strict application of the rules would be unfair.
   By allowing the leader and the co-leaders to make exceptions, the clan can ensure that all members are treated fairly.

1. **Be respectful and helpful to all clan members.**

   Please be respectful and helpful to all clan members.
   This will help to create a positive and supportive environment, improve communication and teamwork, and attract and retain new members.

1. **Harassment or bullying is not tolerated.**

   No matter what form it takes, harassment and bullying is never acceptable.
   It is important to remember that everyone deserves to be treated with respect.

   If you encounter harassment or bullying within the clan, please report it to a co-leader or the leader immediately.
   We will take appropriate action to address the situation.

1. **Religious or political discussion is highly discouraged.**

   Religious or political discussion is highly discouraged in this clan to avoid conflict and distract from the purpose of the clan.

   When people with different religious or political beliefs come together, there is a risk of conflict.
   This can be especially damaging in a clan, where members need to be able to work together effectively.
   By discouraging religious or political discussion, the clan can ensure a more harmonious environment.

1. **Spamming is not allowed.**

   Spamming is not allowed in this clan to keep the chat clean and organized.
   Spam can be disruptive and annoying, and it can make it difficult for clan members to find important information.
   Additionally, spam can be used to spread malware or other malicious content.

1. **Discussing or promoting nudity, pornography, and LGBTQ+ is strictly prohibited.**

   Discussing or promoting nudity, pornography, and LGBTQ+ is strictly prohibited in this clan, as it is illegal in Bangladesh.
   The laws of Bangladesh prohibit the dissemination of pornography and other obscene materials, as well as the promotion of homosexuality.
   Violating these laws can result in serious penalties, including imprisonment.

   _N.B. Our clan is based in [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh), but we recruit players from other countries too._

1. **Follow the instructions of the leader and co-leaders.**

   Following the leader's and co-leaders' instructions is essential for maintaining order and achieving common goals.
   Leaders and co-leaders have the experience and expertise to make informed decisions that benefit the entire clan.
   Clan members can contribute to clan success by adhering to these instructions.

1. **Breaking the rules may result in a warning or kick out from the clan.**

   Breaking the rules may result in a warning or kick out from the clan, depending on the severity of the offense.
   This is to maintain order and discipline in the clan and to create a more enjoyable experience for everyone.
