## Contributing

We're always on the lookout for contributors who can help us improve our clan rules and make them the best they can be.
If you're interested in lending a hand, please follow these guidelines:

- Before you start making any changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/0xMehedi/the-newcomer/issues/new) to briefly describe what you want to change and why.
  This will help us to understand your proposal and to coordinate with other contributors.

- Our clan rules are written in a clear, concise, and respectful tone.
  Please try to match this style and tone in your proposed changes.

- When proposing changes to the clan rules, please consider the impact they will have on all members of the clan.
  Make sure that your changes are fair and equitable, and that they will help to create a positive and supportive clan environment.
